===============

backbone jquery pilot project

Experimenting with backbone setup and jquery.  First version includes model, collection, html and styling.  Add model is working but still ironing out edit/delete functionality.  Since the app is lacking a restfull server, it is hiding and showing product lists and forms temporarily.


TODO...
- Setup a restful server
- Hook up router 
- templatize the markup (mustache, handlebars)
- SASS'ify CSS
- make iterators for the fields in form submission (instead of extracting each value)
- form validation
- improve the catalog styling
- user views - 'product admin' vs 'customer' for orders
- properly breakout index.php into templates, models, views, collections

- Backbone 	- proper file organization
				- proper mgmt of IDs
